# watchlist
Hello! This is a Java program where users can track and update the shows that they watch (only using the terminal). 

After I finished writing the program, I realized that the limited space of the terminal made it difficult for users to actually interact with the program without getting frustrated with the format. So, I decided to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that would not only make the program more user friendly, but also more aesthetically pleasing. 

Check out the code for the GUI!
